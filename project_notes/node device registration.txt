=======Node device registrations==========
Every legitimate device that will function as a node device for this system must
be registered/known by the server.
In IoT telemetry data operations, the server typically has a public key configured
which every device that wants to send data to it must also have saved. 

Also, in this system, we would like to be able to two different devices apart (unique
device ids for all devices). An api point could exist that will be responsible for 
enabling devices obtain their IDs and tokens that will authorize them to function as
node devices of the system.

    == device registration api point on the server (protected)
    == feature on the node device that will access the api point and store the necessary
        information in defined locations in the node device.
