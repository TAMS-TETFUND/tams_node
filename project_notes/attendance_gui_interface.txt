================Details of the Attendance GUI Interface========================
===========================Home================================================
    1.  Take Attendance
    2.  Continue a previous attendance-taking session


===========================Take Attendance=====================================
    1.  Lecture
    2.  Exam
    3.  Continuous Assessment
    4.  Lab

===========================Lecture=============================================
    +   initiator - begin by verifying the identity of the attendance session initiator
    +   Faculty -  What faculty is the course under?
    +   Department
    +   Course
    ****is it really necessary in all scenarios that a staff has to start 
        an attendance-taking session?
    +   Start time - should not be earlier than the current date
    +   Duration (added to start time to get stop time)
    +   session
    +   Preferred Biometric mode (Fingerprint/Face) - Might be a system setting

===========================Attendance Session====================================
    +   Poll for QR code - (Prompt student to present QR code on class admit card/ID card)
    
    ===On successful read
        ====On successful student record retrieval
            + Poll for biometric info of student
            ====On successful verification save attendance record for student
            - Return to Poll for QR code
            - Increment count of student attendance marked for the current attendance session 
                (which is displayed on the attendance session window)

            ===On unsuccessful verification, if only one biometric verification mode is available, 
                prompt user to re-try
                - If successful follow Procedure described above
                -else inform the user he was unsessful the second time
                **The user should not be allowed to re-enter the same registration number at the 
                    "Poll for QR Code" stage**

    ====If read not successful
        ===Prompt student to use the onscreen keyboard for manual entry
            - Follow Procedure described above for handling the user's interaction with the 
                system from this point

===============================Exam=====================================================
For a Faculty course, a staff of a different Department might initiate the attendance-taking session
for the examination. In fact, the assumption that a staff of a different department cannot start A
session for a course from a different department is wrong.
================================Useability==================================================
    +   there should be a 'Scheduled Events' feature where scheduled events and recurring events will
        be listed (sorted according to the days of the week)
    +   Only a lecture/Lab event can be a recurring event.
    +   Any one can schedule an event but only a duly registered staff can activate/initialize it.
    +   Can more than one staff access the same scheduled event? Once a staff initializes a scheduled event
        should he/she be the only person allowed to reactivate/continue the session in the event of a disruption
        in the attendance-taking session? - Yes
==================================Suggestions============================================
system will be more useable if user could set a particular event as recurring (weekly)
a button for starting a scheduled event on the homepage

=======================================implementation=================================
For the sake of maintainability, GUI solution should be class-based. 

Every window will be a class
Every window could be based on a base class where general functionalities like input validation would be 
    implemented
There could be a GUI class where the main loop of the program resides or the main loop could
    be just a function.
