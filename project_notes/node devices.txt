There could be a small web app on the node device for sharing 
logged attendance with lecturers at the end of the attendance-
taking process. 
- Only Staff should be allowed to access this web app
- A staff should only have access to attendance records that they initiated
- If the attendance record model on every node device maintains the same state 
    (i.e. if they're synchronized), then a Staff could fetch her attendance
    records whenever they are in proximity with any of the node device or they
    could get it by connecting to the server. 
- If how much of the attendance records should actually be maintained by the 
    node devices?
- It does not seem useful for a node device to maintain attendance records of
    previous academic sessions. (This data could be retained on the server for 
    a longer period of time).

- what will happen if a user erroneously alters the session settings and causes 
    the system to clear all attendance records that the alteration renders 
    unnecessary? 

** -To allow for some margin, let the node devices retain attendance records
    for EXACTLY TWO ACADEMIC SESSIONS **


================================node device web app==================================
    
    On the node device web app:
    - Staff should be prompted to login
    - staff will find their dashboard with the option of downloading attendance records
        that they initiated.
==============================todos===============================================
    -   add paginator to the attendance records page of the web app
    -   finish implementation of the fingerprint class
    -   add desktop feature that starts up the web app and stops it.
    -   show status of an attendance session (with option of ending it on the web app) or 
        it could be that when a user opts to download attendance logged for an event, you 
        prompt the user to end attendance. and prevent the user from downloading attendance
        records when attendance session is still active.
    -   ideally, the casing of staff number should not matter when logging in. Handle issue of
        letter casing affecting authentication.
    -   could implement the printing of ID card on the web app. (is this advisable?)
    -   UI/UX issues on both desktop app and web app.
