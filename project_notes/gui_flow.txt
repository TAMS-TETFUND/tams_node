HomeWindow -> New Event (button) -> EventMenuWindow -> AcademicSessionDetailsWindow -> EventDetailWindow -> NewEventSummaryWindow -> Start Event (button) -> StaffBarcodeCameraWindow -> StaffFaceVerificationWindow -> 
                                                                                                                                  -> Schedule Event (button) -> HomeWindow
                                                                                                                                                                                ->StaffNumberInputWindow -> StaffFaceVerificationWindow

Can the windows be stateless? Would it be necessary for the windows to be stateless?
